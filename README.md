[![Badge for version for Visual Studio Code extension gencay.vscode-chatgpt](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visual%20Studio%20Marketplace-v2.5.1-brightgreen)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gencay.vscode-chatgpt)

## üì¢ December 25 Update - Chromium-based browser solution

The extension is expected to work without any 403s or 429s since it will now use the browser behind the scenes to make the chatGPT requests. Please make sure that `autologin` setting is set to `true` (default is `true`) and you **keep the browser open** all the time after logging in. It'll be automatically minimized after successful login. You can then ask questions to ChatGPT via the extension as usual.

# ChatGPT as your copilot to level up your developer experience

- ü§ñ Zero-Config setup. Simply login to OpenAI as usual.
- üìé Detects partial code response and suggests automatic continuation and combination of multiple answers.
- ‚û°Ô∏è Export all your conversation history at once in Markdown format.
- üí≠ Preset commands + Customization to use any prompt for a selected code.
- üìù Create projects/files with one click using built-in actions in the conversation view.
- ‚ö° Built-in syntax highlighting for ChatGPT suggested code using the default code-font of your Visual Studio Code!
- üñºÔ∏è Icon is generated by dall-e-2.

# Zero Configuration with Browser Auto Login

- Zero-Config Autologin lets the extension grab the required tokens automatically using `puppeteer`. The extension will use the browser behind the scenes, so you are not expected to receive 4xx errors while asking ChatGPT via extension unless there is OpenAI outages.

- **2 options to run ChatGPT assistant in your vs-code**:

  1. [**Recommended**] Autologin - Uses browser to ask questions to ChatGPT. [Autologin Setup (Default)](#setup)
  2. Manually login on a browser and grab required tokens. Described in [Manual Setup](#manual-setup). This option has problems due to using unofficial OpenAI API usage and rate-limiting.

# Setup

üöÄ All you need to do is click Login or ask a question to get started!

1. Click on extension icon on your sidebar and hit `Login` button.

2. A new browser window (Default is `Chrome` but you may override it with any Chromium-based browser) will open up redirected to https://chat.openai.com/. Wait till you see login page, and click on Login on your browser.

3. Solve captchas if you are prompted and continue.

4. After successfully logging in, the browser will be minimized.

‚ÑπÔ∏è You will need to have a browser open and be logged in at all times. If you close the browser or your VS-Code instance, you will be asked to login again in your next session.

üìù You can have the extension auto-fill the email address and/or password during logins. Update the extension settings with those information for quicker login. NOTE: We never store any of this information locally or remotely.

ü§ñ Below is a sample autologin flow. Simply login & keep your browser minimized for dialogues with ChatGPT:

### Override settings with any Chromium-based browser

1. To use `Edge`, go to this URL:`edge://version` and copy the executable path

   - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1168485/209638697-a52c3aeb-fa75-4f4f-8def-8fbf71980f44.png)

2. Override the chromium path by going to vs-code settings and search for `chatgpt:chromiumPath`. Paste the executable path to the textbox as shown in the below screenshot

3. [Maybe required] Run `ChatGPT: Reset session` command to clear your previous browser selection. This is required only if you have previously authenticated using a different browser.

## Manual Setup

‚ÑπÔ∏è This method is no longer recommended since hard rate-limiting by OpenAI services. Please use the `AutoLogin` option with Zero-Configuration required.

1. Go to https://chat.openai.com and login.
2. Open your browser's developer tools
   - Hit F12 to open the developer tools in most browsers
   - Alternatively, right click on the browser window and select `Inspect`
3. Go to `Application` -> `Cookies` -> `https://chat.openai.com`. You will need the following cookies:
   - `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`: The extension will use this to send prompts to ChatGPT
   - `cf_clearance`: CloudFlare clearance token. A security measure OpenAI put in place to block automated access.
4. Go to `Console` and type in the following code to get your `user-agent`
   - `navigator.userAgent`: This is your browser's user-agent, needed for CloudFlare clearance. Enter the value of `userAgent` when prompted by the extension. Copy its value **without single or double quotes**.
5. Now that you have all required session variables, run any command using the extension and you'll be asked to enter these values:
   - `__Secure-next-auth.session-token`: An encoded token starting with `ey***`
   - `cf_clearance`: An alpha-numeric token
   - `userAgent`

# Troubleshooting

- It's possible that openai systems may experience issues responding to your queries due to high-traffic from time to time.
- If you get `ChatGPTAPI error 429`, it means that you are making Too Many Requests. Please wait and try again in a few moments. If it persists, restart your vs-code.
- If you see `ChatGPTAPI error terminated`, your requests are being throttled. Please try again later.
- If you encounter persistent issues with your queries
  - Try `ChatGPT: Reset session` command
  - As a last resort try restarting your VS-Code and retry logging in.

# Disclaimer and Credits

- During login you'll notice some warnings on your Chromium-based browser about flags that are used to open the browser. This is required to automate your login and conversations with the browser's network.
- This extension never uses/stores your personally identifiable information locally or remotely. It's up to you to use the extension for ChatGPT conversations and we assume no responsibility of any issues that you may face in ChatGPT. Since this is just an experimental project I work on my freetime for the community.
